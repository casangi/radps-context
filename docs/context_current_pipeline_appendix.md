## Implementation Notes by Use Case

The following implementation notes describe how each use case is realized in the current pipeline codebase. They were separated from the use-case definitions to keep the requirements document focused on requirements.

### UC-01 — Load, Update, and Provide Access to Observation Metadata

**Implementation notes** — `context.observing_run` holds the observation metadata and is the most frequently queried attribute of the context:

- `context.observing_run.get_ms(name=vis)` — resolve an MS by filename
- `context.observing_run.measurement_sets` — all registered MS objects
- `context.observing_run.get_measurement_sets_of_type(dtypes)` — filter by data type (RAW, REGCAL_CONTLINE_ALL, BASELINED, etc.)
- `context.observing_run.virtual2real_spw_id(vspw, ms)` / `real2virtual_spw_id(...)` — translate between abstract pipeline SPW IDs and CASA-native IDs
- `context.observing_run.virtual_science_spw_ids` — virtual SPW catalog
- `context.observing_run.ms_reduction_group` — per-group reduction metadata (single-dish)
- Provenance attributes: `start_datetime`, `end_datetime`, `project_ids`, `schedblock_ids`, `execblock_ids`, `observers`

The MS objects stored by `context.observing_run` carry information about scans, fields, SPWs, antennas, reference antenna ordering, etc. Tasks read per-MS state like `ms.reference_antenna`, `ms.session`, `ms.start_time`, `ms.origin_ms`.

### UC-02 — Store and Provide Project-Level Metadata

**Implementation notes** — project metadata is set during initialization or import, is not modified after import, and is read many times:

- `context.project_summary = project.ProjectSummary(...)` — set by `executeppr()` / `executevlappr()`
- `context.project_structure = project.ProjectStructure(...)` — set by PPR executors
- `context.project_performance_parameters` — performance parameters from the PPR
- `context.set_state('ProjectStructure', 'recipe_name', value)` — used by `recipereducer.reduce()` and SD heuristics
- `context.processing_intents` — set by `Pipeline` during initialization

---

### UC-03 — Register, Query, and Update Calibration State

**Implementation notes** — `context.callibrary` is the primary cross-stage communication channel for calibration workflows:

- **Write:** `context.callibrary.add(calto, calfrom)` — register a calibration application (cal table + target selection); `context.callibrary.unregister_calibrations(matcher)` — remove by predicate
- **Read:** `context.callibrary.active.get_caltable(caltypes=...)` — list active cal tables; `context.callibrary.get_calstate(calto)` — get full application state for a target selection
- Backed by `CalApplication` → `CalTo` / `CalFrom` objects with interval trees for efficient matching.

---

### UC-04 — Manage Imaging State

**Implementation notes** — imaging state is stored as ad-hoc attributes on the context object with no formal schema. Defensive `hasattr()` checks appear throughout the code to guard against attributes that may not yet exist:

| Attribute | Written by | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| `clean_list_pending` | `editimlist`, `makeimlist`, `findcont`, `makeimages` | `findcont`, `tclean`, `transformimagedata`, `uvcontsub`, `checkproductsize` |
| `clean_list_info` | `makeimlist`, `makeimages` | display/renderer code |
| `imaging_mode` | `editimlist` | `makermsimages`, `makecutoutimages`, `makeimages` |
| `imaging_parameters` | PPR / `editimlist` | `tclean`, `checkproductsize`, heuristics |
| `synthesized_beams` | `imageprecheck`, `tclean`, `checkproductsize`, `makeimlist`, `makeimages` | `checkproductsize`, heuristics |
| `size_mitigation_parameters` | `checkproductsize` | downstream stages |
| `selfcal_targets`, `selfcal_resources` | `selfcal` | `exportdata` |

---

### UC-05 — Register and Query Produced Image Products

**Implementation notes** — image libraries provide typed registries:

- `context.sciimlist` — science images
- `context.calimlist` — calibrator images
- `context.rmsimlist` — RMS images
- `context.subimlist` — sub-product images (cutouts, cubes)

---

### UC-06 — Track Current Execution Progress

**Implementation notes:**

- `context.stage`, `context.task_counter`, `context.subtask_counter` track progress

---

### UC-07 — Preserve Per-Stage Execution Record

**Implementation notes:**

- `context.results` holds an ordered list of `ResultsProxy` objects which are proxied to disk to bound memory
- Timetracker integration provides per-stage timing data
- Results proxies store basenames for portability

---

### UC-08 — Propagate Task Outputs to Downstream Tasks

**Implementation notes** — the current pipeline satisfies these needs through two different propagation paths:

1. **Immediate state propagation** — `Results.merge_with_context(context)` updates calibration library, image libraries, and more so later tasks can access the current processing state directly.
2. **Serialized Results** — tasks read `context.results` to find outputs from earlier stages when those outputs are needed from the recorded results rather than from merged shared state. For example:
   - VLA tasks compute `stage_number` from `context.results[-1].read().stage_number + 1`
   - `vlassmasking` iterates `context.results[::-1]` to find the latest `MakeImagesResult`
   - Export/AQUA code reads `context.results[0]` and `context.results[-1]` for timestamps

---

### UC-09 — Support Multiple Orchestration Drivers

**Implementation notes** — multiple entry points converge on the same task execution path:

- **Task-driven**: direct task calls via CLI wrappers in `pipeline/h/cli/`
- **Command-list-driven**: PPR and XML procedure commands via `executeppr.py` / `executevlappr.py` and `recipereducer.py`

They differ in how inputs are specified, how session paths are selected, and how resume is initiated, but the persisted context is the same.

---

### UC-10 — Save and Restore a Processing Session

**Implementation notes:**

- `h_save()` pickles the whole context to `<context.name>.context`
- `h_resume(filename)` loads a `.context` file, defaulting to the most recent context file available if `filename` is `None` or `last` is used.
- Per-stage results are proxied to disk (`saved_state/result-stageX.pickle`) to keep the in-memory context smaller
- Used by driver-managed breakpoint/resume (`executeppr(..., bpaction='resume')`) and developer debugging workflows

---

### UC-11 — Provide State to Parallel Workers

**Implementation notes** — `pipeline/infrastructure/mpihelpers.py`, class `Tier0PipelineTask`:

1. The MPI client saves the context to disk as a pickle: `context.save(path)`.
2. Task arguments are also pickled to disk alongside the context.
3. On the server, `get_executable()` loads the context, modifies `context.logs['casa_commands']` to a server-local temp path, creates the task's `Inputs(context, **task_args)`, then executes the task.
4. For `Tier0JobRequest` (lower-level distribution), the executor is shallow-copied *excluding* the context reference to stay within the MPI buffer limit (~150 MiB, see PIPE-1337).

---

### UC-13 — Provide Read-Only State for Reporting

**Implementation notes** — `WebLogGenerator.render(context)` in `pipeline/infrastructure/renderer/htmlrenderer.py`:

- Reads `context.results` — unpickled from `ResultsProxy` objects, iterated for every renderer
- Reads `context.report_dir`, `context.output_dir` — filesystem layout
- Reads `context.observing_run.*` — MS metadata, scheduling blocks, execution blocks, observers, project IDs, start/end times
- Reads `context.project_summary.telescope` — to determine telescope-specific page layouts (ALMA vs VLA vs NRO)
- Reads `context.project_structure.*` — OUS IDs, PPR file, recipe name
- Reads `context.logs['casa_commands']` — CASA command history

---

### UC-14 — Support QA Evaluation and Store Quality Assessments

**Implementation notes** — after `merge_with_context()`, `accept()` triggers `pipelineqa.qa_registry.do_qa(context, result)`:

- QA handlers implement `QAPlugin.handle(context, result)`
- The context provides inputs to QA evaluation:
  - Most handlers call `context.observing_run.get_ms(vis)` to look up metadata for scoring (antenna count, channel count, SPW properties, field intents)
  - Some handlers check `context.imaging_mode` to branch on VLASS-specific scoring
  - Others check things in `context.observing_run`, `context.project_structure`, or the callibrary (`context.callibrary`)
- Scores are appended to `result.qa.pool`, so the scores are stored on the results rather than directly on the context. 

QA handlers write scores to `result.qa.pool` and do not modify the shared context directly.

---

### UC-16 — Manage Telescope-Specific State

This use case is based on a VLA-specific sub-context (`context.evla`) which is created during `hifv_importdata` and is updated by several subsequent tasks. Functionally, it provides a way to store observation metadata and pass state between tasks under `context.evla` rather than using the top-level context directly or other context objects (e.g. the domain objects). `context.evla` is an untyped, dictionary-of-dictionaries sidecar dynamically attached to the top-level context with no schema, no type annotations, and no declaration in `Context.__init__`.

**Implementation notes** — `context.evla` is a `collections.defaultdict(dict)`, keyed as `context.evla['msinfo'][ms_name].<property>`:

- **Written by:** `hifv_importdata` (creates + initializes), `testBPdcals` (gain intervals, ignorerefant), `fluxscale/solint`, `fluxboot`
- **Read by:** Most VLA calibration tasks and heuristics
- Accessed fields include: `gain_solint1`, `gain_solint2`, `setjy_results`, `ignorerefant`, various `*_field_select_string` / `*_scan_select_string` values, `fluxscale_sources`, `spindex_results`, and many more

## Context Lifecycle

The canonical flow through the context is:

1. **Create session** — `h_init()` constructs a `launcher.Pipeline(...)` and returns a new `Context`. In PPR-driven execution, `executeppr()` or `executevlappr()` also populates project metadata at this point.
2. **Load data** — Import tasks (`h*_importdata`) attach datasets to the context's domain model (`context.observing_run`, measurement sets, scans, SPWs, etc.).
3. **Execute tasks** — Tasks execute against the in-memory context and return a `Results` object. After each task, `Results.accept(context)` records the outcome and mutates shared state.
4. **Accept results** — Inside `accept()`, results are merged via `Results.merge_with_context(context)`. A `ResultsProxy` is pickled to disk per-stage to keep the in-memory context bounded. The weblog is typically rendered after each top-level stage.
5. **Save / resume** — `h_save()` pickles the context; `h_resume(filename='last')` restores it. Driver-managed breakpoints and developer debugging workflows rely on this cycle.
